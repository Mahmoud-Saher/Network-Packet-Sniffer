# Network-Packet-Sniffer


ðŸ“Œ Project Idea â€“ Network Packet Sniffer

This project is a Python-based Packet Sniffer built using the scapy library.

It captures live network traffic from the network interface.

For each packet, it extracts and displays:
ðŸ”¹ Source & Destination IP addresses
ðŸ”¹ Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
ðŸ”¹ Ports (for TCP/UDP)
ðŸ”¹ Payload data (if available)

The main goal is to gain a practical understanding of how data flows through networks and to explore the basics of network protocols.

This project is a simple introduction to how professional tools like Wireshark work and is a great step for anyone interested in Networking or Cybersecurity.
